Dr. Tan: Good morning, Ms. Chua. Thank you for coming in today. I understand that you’ve been thinking a lot about your treatment options. How are you feeling?Ms. Chua: Good morning, Dr. Tan. I’m very worried. I know my tumor is big, but I just cannot accept the idea of losing my breast. I don’t want a mastectomy if there’s any way to avoid it.Dr. Tan: I understand how difficult this decision can be. Since your tumor is large, a mastectomy is typically the recommended approach. However, in some cases, we can try neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) first. This means giving chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor, potentially allowing for breast-conserving surgery instead of a mastectomy.Ms. Chua: Really? So there’s a chance I might not need a mastectomy if the tumor shrinks enough?Dr. Tan: Yes, that’s possible. NACT can reduce the tumor size, and if the response is good, we may be able to proceed with a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy. However, the response to chemotherapy varies between patients. If the tumor does not shrink enough, we may still need to do a mastectomy.Ms. Chua: I see. What are the risks of trying chemotherapy first?Dr. Tan: The main risks are the side effects of chemotherapy, which include nausea, hair loss, fatigue, and a weakened immune system. There’s also a chance that the tumor may not respond well enough, meaning you may still need a mastectomy later. However, the benefit is that if the tumor does respond, you may be able to keep your breast.Ms. Chua: I really want to try. If there’s even a chance I can avoid mastectomy, I think I should go for it.Dr. Tan: That’s a reasonable approach. We will monitor your tumor’s response closely with imaging and reassess after a few cycles of chemotherapy. If the tumor shrinks adequately, we can plan for breast-conserving surgery. If not, we will discuss the next steps together.Ms. Chua: Okay, I’m willing to try. Thank you for explaining everything to me.
