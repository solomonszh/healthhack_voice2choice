      "Ms. Chua: Good morning, Dr. Tan. I’m very worried. I know my tumor is big, but I just cannot accept the idea of losing my breast. I don’t want a mastectomy if there’s any way to avoid it.\n",
      "Dr. Tan: I understand how difficult this decision can be. Since your tumor is large, a mastectomy is typically the recommended approach. However, in some cases, we can try neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) first. This means giving chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor, potentially allowing for breast-conserving surgery instead of a mastectomy.\n",
      "Ms. Chua: Really? So there’s a chance I might not need a mastectomy if the tumor shrinks enough?\n",
      "Dr. Tan: Yes, that’s possible. NACT can reduce the tumor size, and if the response is good, we may be able to proceed with a lumpectomy instead of a mastectomy. However, the response to chemotherapy varies between patients. If the tumor does not shrink enough, we may still need to do a mastectomy.\n",
      "Ms. Chua: I see. What are the risks of trying chemotherapy first?\n",
      "Dr. Tan: The main risks are the side effects of chemotherapy, which include nausea, hair loss, fatigue, and a weakened immune system. There’s also a chance that the tumor may not respond well enough, meaning you may still need a mastectomy later. However, the benefit is that if the tumor does respond, you may be able to keep your breast.\n",
      "Ms. Chua: I really want to try. If there’s even a chance I can avoid mastectomy, I think I should go for it.\n",
      "Dr. Tan: That’s a reasonable approach. We will monitor your tumor’s response closely with imaging and reassess after a few cycles of chemotherapy. If the tumor shrinks adequately, we can plan for breast-conserving surgery. If not, we will discuss the next steps together.\n",

      "Mdm Chua: Good morning, Dr. Tan. I’m feeling quite anxious, to be honest. I know my cancer was caught early, but I keep worrying about it coming back.\n",

      "Mdm Chua: I keep thinking—what if the cancer isn’t fully removed? What if it comes back later? I don’t want to go through this again. I don’t know if I should just remove everything to be safe.\n",
      "Dr. Tan: That’s completely understandable. There are two main surgical options: a lumpectomy, which removes only the tumor while keeping the breast, and a mastectomy, which removes the entire breast. Both options have comparable survival rates, meaning neither is a \"better\" choice in terms of overall life expectancy.\n",
      "Mdm Chua: But if I remove everything, doesn’t that mean the risk is lower?\n",
      "Dr. Tan: A mastectomy lowers the risk of cancer coming back in the same breast, but when combined with radiotherapy, a lumpectomy offers a very similar recurrence rate. That means keeping your breast is still a safe option.\n",
      "Mdm Chua: But what if there are still cancer cells left behind after the lumpectomy?\n",
      "Dr. Tan: That’s a good question. After a lumpectomy, we carefully examine the surgical margins—the area around the tumor that was removed. If the margins are clear, the risk of recurrence is low. However, if the margins are not clear, there is a higher risk of cancer returning, and your surgeon will usually recommend a second surgery to remove more tissue.\n",
      "Mdm Chua: So, there’s a chance I might need a second operation?\n",
      "Dr. Tan: Yes, about 5-15% of patients need a second surgery after a lumpectomy to ensure all the cancer is removed. But if you are okay with that possibility, a lumpectomy is still an excellent option. If you strongly prefer to avoid a second surgery, a mastectomy would be the more definitive choice.\n",
      "Mdm Chua: I just want to feel safe. Maybe removing everything is better for my anxiety.\n",
      "Dr. Tan: That’s completely understandable. If having the entire breast removed would give you peace of mind and help you feel more confident about your treatment, a mastectomy might be the right choice for you. You can also consider reconstruction if you wish.\n",

      " '   - The best course of treatment for Ms. Chua is to pursue neoadjuvant '\n",
      " 'chemotherapy (NACT) followed by a reassessment for breast-conserving surgery '\n",
      " '(lumpectomy) if the tumor shrinks adequately.\\n'\n",
      " '\\n'\n",
      " '2. **Justifications for the Course:**\\n'\n",
      " '   - **Opportunity for Tumor Reduction:** The primary justification for NACT '\n",
      " 'is to shrink the tumor size before surgery. Given that Ms. Chua is concerned '\n",
      " 'about losing her breast, this approach provides her with a chance to '\n",
      " 'maintain breast integrity if the tumor responds well to chemotherapy.\\n'\n",
      " '   - **Monitoring Response:** By using NACT, the oncologist can monitor how '\n",
      " 'well the tumor responds to treatment. A favorable response can provide '\n",
      " \"valuable information on the tumor's biology, which can guide future \"\n",
      " 'treatment decisions.\\n'\n",
      " '   - **Psychological Consideration:** Understanding her concerns about '\n",

      " 'decision while potentially avoiding the significant emotional impact of '\n",
      " 'losing her breast.\\n'\n",
      " '   - **Timing of Surgery:** NACT can afford time for proper assessment of '\n",
      " 'the tumor and allow for planning of the most suitable surgical approach '\n",
      " 'based on the treatment response.\\n'\n",
      " '\\n'\n",
      " '3. **Chain of Thought to Reach Justifications:**\\n'\n",
      " '   - Ms. Chua expressed a significant emotional barrier to mastectomy due to '\n",
      " 'a strong attachment to her breast. Thus, seeking an alternative that '\n",
      " 'provides a chance for breast preservation is paramount.\\n'\n",
      " '   - Considering her tumor is large, typical recommendations gravitate '\n",
      " 'toward mastectomy; however, the option of NACT introduces the possibility of '\n",
      " 'tumor reduction. Hence, the rationale to treat her with chemotherapy first '\n",
      " 'stems from both physical and psychosocial aspects of her treatment.\\n'\n",
      " '   - The oncological community acknowledges the efficacy of NACT in managing '\n",
      " 'locally advanced breast cancer, and emerging evidence suggests that patients '\n",
      " 'undergoing NACT prior to surgery could experience similar outcomes in terms '\n",
      " 'of recurrence rates as those opting for upfront mastectomy.\\n'\n",
      " '\\n'\n",
      " '4. **Risks to Patient:**\\n'\n",
      " '   - **Side Effects of Chemotherapy:** The patient needs to be informed '\n",

      " 'nausea, fatigue, hair loss, and a weakened immune system, which could impact '\n",
      " 'her quality of life during treatment.\\n'\n",
      " '   - **Incomplete Tumor Response:** There remains a risk that the tumor may '\n",
      " 'not respond sufficiently to chemotherapy, in which case a mastectomy might '\n",
      " 'still be necessary, leading to a situation where Ms. Chua still has to face '\n",
      " 'her original fears.\\n'\n",
      " '   - **Timing and Uncertainty:** Delaying surgery with the hope that the '\n",
      " 'chemotherapy will reduce tumor size can cause psychological stress for the '\n",
      " 'patient if the anticipated response does not occur or the timeline extends '\n",
      " 'longer than expected.\\n'\n",
      " '   - **Additional Surgical Risks:** If the first surgical attempt '\n",
      " '(lumpectomy) is not successful due to unclear margins, there may be the need '\n",
      " 'for a second surgery, which can be a source of additional anxiety and '\n",
